# Word-Guess-Game

This is a hangman-like game that is initiated upon user input from the keyboard and runs scripts to determine if the letter pressed is existant in a word that was randomly chosen from a pool of provided words (name of NBA teams). If the user is able to fully identify the word within the number of provided guess attempts, the user adds to the win count. If the user runs out of attempts, the loss counter raises.

This project is useful in learning the syntax of basic javascript including how to reference and write text to HTML, how to use If/else/else if/for, functions, and variables.
